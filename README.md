Prerequisites
Before running the DrawingGame server, you will need the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Node.js: DrawingGame is built on Node.js, so make sure you have it installed. You can download it from the official website.

npm: npm is the package manager for Node.js and comes bundled with Node.js installation. You'll need it to install project dependencies.

Installation
Clone the DrawingGame repository to your local machine:

Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DrawingGame.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Install the required Node.js dependencies:
To run the DrawingGame server, you'll need to start both the WebSocket (ws) server and the HTTP server using the npx http-server module. Here's how to get started:

Start the WebSocket (ws) server:

bash
Copy code
"cd DrawingGame app"
npm server
This command will launch the WebSocket server, and you should see a message indicating that the server is listening on a specific port (e.g., Listening on port 8080).

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the project directory.

Start the HTTP server using npx http-server:

bash
Copy code
"cd DrawingGame app" // "cd .."
npx http-server
This will serve the game client files on a specific port (by default, http://localhost:8081).

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8081 to access the DrawingGame client.
